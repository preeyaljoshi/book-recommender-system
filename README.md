## Book Recommender System

A simple book recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques, built with scikit-learn and Flask for a web-based interface.

### Project Files
- `Book Recommendation System.ipynb`: Model training and evaluation.
- `app.py`: Flask app to serve recommendations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage
1. Run the app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open in your browser:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

## How It Works
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends books based on user preferences and similar users.
  
## Future Enhancements
- Add content-based filtering.
- Improve model accuracy.
